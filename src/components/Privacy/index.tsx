        on your computer or device when you visit a site. The cookie will help
        the website, or another website, to recognize your device the next time
        you visit. Web beacons, pixels or other similar files can also do the
        same thing. We use the term “cookies” in this policy to refer to all
        files that collect information in this way.
      </Typography>
      <Typography type="smallBody">
        Cookies serve many functions. For example, they can help us to remember
        your username and preferences, analyze how well our Sites are
        performing, or allow us to recommend content we believe will be most
        relevant to you.
      </Typography>
      <Typography type="smallBody">
        The majority of websites use cookies to collect and retain personal
        information about their visitors. Most cookies collect general
        information, such as how visitors arrive at and use our Sites, the
        device they are using, their internet protocol address (IP address),
        what pages they are viewing and their approximate location (for example,
        we would be able to recognize that you are visiting our Sites from
        London).
      </Typography>
      <Typography type="smallBody">
        <Typography type="bodyAlt">Purpose of cookies</Typography>
        We group our cookies into the below categories.
      </Typography>
      <Typography type="smallBody">
        <Typography type="bodyAlt">Operating our Sites</Typography>
        Some cookies are essential for the operation of our Sites. This includes
        cookies for the following purposes:
      </Typography>
      <Typography type="smallBody">
        Performance – we use these cookies to monitor Site performance. This
        allows us to provide a high-quality experience by quickly identifying
        and fixing any issues that arise. For example, we might use performance
        cookies to track error messages, and to determine improvements to our
        Sites.
      </Typography>
      <Typography type="smallBody">
        Functionality – we use functionality cookies to allow us to remember
        your preferences. For example, we use functionality cookies to provide
        you with enhanced services, such as allowing you to watch a video online
        or comment on a blog.
      </Typography>
      <Typography type="smallBody">
        Analytics – we use cookies to help us understand our audience and the
        success of advertising campaigns. For example, we count articles views
        to present ‘Most Read’ content. We also use analytics cookies to keep
        track of how many advertising impressions have been served for a
        campaign and to manage the frequency at which you see the same adverts.
      </Typography>
      <Typography type="smallBody">
        Fraud prevention – we use cookies to monitor and prevent suspicious
        activity and fraudulent traffic. Advertising
      </Typography>
      <Typography type="smallBody">
        We use cookies to serve you with advertisements that we believe are
        relevant to you and your interests. You may see these advertisements on
        our Sites and on other sites that you visit. For example, if you read a
        number of articles on the BVI, you may see an advertisement for a BVI
        company as we have inferred that you are interested in this topic. You
        may also see advertisements for our products and services on other
        websites if you have previously visited our Sites.
      </Typography>
      <Typography type="smallBody">
        For our Sites that offer behaviorally or demographically targeted
        advertising, you will have the opportunity to turn this off in your
        account. Please note, if you turn this off you will still see the same
        number of advertisements, but they may be less relevant to you. You may
        continue to see “contextual” advertisements that are not targeted based
        on your personal information – for example, a motoring advertisement
        presented on a motoring article.

      </Typography>
      <Typography type="smallBody">
        <ul>
          <li>

            have shared with third parties, to the extent that you have
            consented to this.

          <li>
            Informing our advertisers (in aggregate) how many users have clicked
