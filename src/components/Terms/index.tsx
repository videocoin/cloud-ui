        <ul>
          <li>
            (a) Complete Agreement: These T&C set forth the entire understanding
            between each User and the Company and the VideoCoin Team with
            respect to the purchase and sale of Tokens. For facts relating to
            the sale and purchase, the User agrees to rely only on the
            Agreements in determining purchase decisions and understands that
            these documents govern the sale of Tokens and supersede any public
            statements about the Token Presale made by third parties or by the
            VideoCoin Team or Company or individuals associated with VideoCoin
            Team or Company, past and present and during the Token Presale.
          </li>
          <li>
            (b) Severability: If any term, clause or provision of these T&C is
            held unlawful, void or unenforceable, then that term, clause or
            provision will be severable from these T&C and will not affect the
            validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term,
            clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of these
            T&C.
          </li>
          <li>
            (c) No Waiver: The failure of the Website Owner to require or
            enforce strict performance by the Purchaser of any provision of
            these Agreements or failure to exercise any right under these
            Agreements shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of
            the Company’s right to assert or rely upon any such provision or
            right in that or any other instance. The express waiver by the
            Company of any provision, condition, or requirement of these T&C
            shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply
            with such provision, condition or requirement. Except as expressly
            and specifically set forth in this these T&C, no representations,
            statements, consents, waivers, or other acts or omissions by the
            Company shall be deemed a modification of these T&C nor be legally
            binding, unless documented in physical writing, and executed by the
            User and a duly appointed officer, employee, or agent of the
            Company.
          </li>
          <li>
            (d) Force Majeure: The Company is not liable for failure to perform
            solely caused by: unavoidable casualty, delays in delivery of
            materials, embargoes, government orders, acts of civil or military
            authorities, acts by common carriers, emergency conditions
            (including weather conditions) incompatible with safety or good
            quality workmanship, or any similar unforeseen event that renders
            performance commercially implausible. If an event of force majeure
            occurs, the Party injured by the other’s inability to perform may
            elect to suspend the Agreements, in whole or part, for the duration
            of the force majeure circumstances. The Party experiencing the force
            majeure circumstances shall cooperate with and assist the injured
            Party in all reasonable ways to minimize the impact of force majeure
            on the injured Party.
          </li>
          <li>
            (e) Cooperation with Legal Authorities: The Company and VideoCoin
            Team will cooperate with all law enforcement enquiries, subpoenas,

            law in the relevant jurisdictions.

            Owner in complying with all of the mentioned regulations and provide
            any necessary information if such is required from the User by the
            competent authority.
          </li>
          <li>
            (g) Updates: The Agreements may be updated with or without notice
            from time to time and the version available at the Website on a
            given date will be considered as the governing document for any
            incidents arising on that date. An update of the Agreements on the
            Website will be considered as valid notice to everyone and all users
            and interested parties are requested to visit the Website regularly
            to update themselves about the latest updates to the Agreements.
          </li>

          <li>
            iii. the words include and including, and variations thereof, shall

          </li>
          <li>
            (j) Assignment: The User shall not assign any of the Agreements,
