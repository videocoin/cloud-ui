        The French Revolution constituted for the conscience of the dominant
        aristocratic class a fall from innocence, and upturning of the natural
        chain of events that resounded all over Europe; the old regime became,
        in their imaginary, a paradise lost. This explains why some romantic
        poets born in the higher classes were keen on seeing themselves as faded
        aristocrats, expelled from their comfortable milieu by a reverse of
        fortune or a design of destiny. Byron and Shelley are the prime
        instances of this vital pose. In The Giaour he writes on a vampiric
        character: “The common crowd but see the gloom/ Of wayward deeds and
        fitting doom;/ The close observer can espy/A noble soul, and lineage
        high.”

        Byron departed from England leaving a trail of scandal over his marital
        conduct and since then saw himself as an exiled expatriate. Shelley was
        expelled from Oxford and he fell in disgrace by marrying an in-keeper’s
        daughter; he always struggled to reconcile his origin with his political
        ideas: “Shelley could find no way of resolving his own contradictory
        opinions” (Cronin, 2000).

        This icon of the fallen aristocrat is rooted on another character
        revered by romantic poets: the fallen angel. As Mario Praz proves,
        miltonic Satan became the rebel figure of choice among romantic poets.
        Milton reversed the medieval idea of a hideous Satan and wrapped its
        figure with the epic grandeur of an angel fallen in disgrace. Many of
        the byronic heros share with Milton’s Satan this fallen-from-grace
        condition, such as Lara: “There was in him a vital scorn of all:/ As if
        the worst had fall’n which could befall,/ stood a stranger in this
        breathing world,/An erring spirit from another hurl’d” ( Lara XVIII
        315-16)

        There is another social factor that is behind the formation of the
        romantic myth of the vampire. In the early nineteen century, the
        foundations of what would later become a mass society were laid; the
        expansion of the press and of the reading public produced an increased
        diffusion for literary works and fostered movements such as the gothic
        and the sensation novel. Byron himself experienced the event of being
        turned into a proto-bestseller. The unification of literary taste and
        preferences that was a correlate to this social changes could not be
        more alien to the romantic notion of individual gusto and original
        sensibility. In order to combat this unifying forces, romantic poets
        revered the individual who stands outside society and is free from
        common concerns. Many of Byron’s heros look down on the masses from
        above, even though they walk among them and do not lean towards
        wordsworthian escapades into nature; they achieve to remain untainted by
        the masses in a sort of exile within the world akin to that of a ghost
        or a dammed spirit. This self-definition of Manfred is revelatory:

        My spirit walk’d not with the souls of men, Nor look’d upon the earth

        their existence was not mine; My joys, my griefs, my passions, and my
        powers Made me a stranger; though I wore the form, I had no sympathy
        with breathing flesh, (Manfred II, ii, 50-58)

        Not only Byron’s works contrived to produce the modern image of the
        vampire in relation to the Male Seducer archetype, but also some odd
        events in his life and the life of those surrounding him exercised a
        decisive influence. A critical study bundled with an anthology of
        vampire tales (Conde de Siruela, 2001) attributes to the short story The
        Vampire (1819) by John William Polidori the fixation of the “classical
        images of the literary vampire as a villanious, cold and enigmatic
        aristocrat; but, above all, perverse and fascinating for women”. Mario
        Praz, in the same line, also states that Byron was “largely responsible
        for the vogue of vampirism”. Polidori was the unfortunate doctor and
        personal assistant of Lord Byron who died half-crazy at 25. The idea for
        the tale published in 1819 came from the famous meetings at Villa
        Diodati on June 1816 between Byron, Percy Shelley, Mary Shelley and
        Polidori, in what was probably the most influential gathering for
        fantastic fiction in the history of modern literature. In order to pass
        the stormy and ether-fuelled nights, they agreed to write each one a
        ghost story. Mary Shelley (who was then 17 years old) got during these
        nights the idea of what later became Frankenstein and Polidori wrote the
        tale The Vampire that he would publish three years later. The story
        appeared in the New Monthly Magazine falsely attributed by the editor to
        Lord Byron (taking advantages of the aura of Satanism that surrounded
        the poet in the popular view to promote the sales of the magazine). A
        misguided Goethe hailed the story as the best that Lord Byron had ever
        written. The tale was, actually, a covert portrait of Lord Byron
        disguised as the vampire Lord Ruthven, a cruel gambler and killer of
        innocent girls. Polidori had introduced in the story fragments from an
        autobiographical and revengeful novel called Glenarvon written by
        Caroline Lamb, an ex-lover of Byron. The Lord
